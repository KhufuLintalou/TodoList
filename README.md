All of these projects that I made usually followed what are specified on the related Odin Page. [Link to this one](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).  
I might have a use case for this so I added some stuff that might make this actually usable like Category for the todos.

The scale of this one was bigger than the others I had done so far so I'm not really sure how to really tidy up the JS, I did attempt to though as you can see... The CSS codes could also be made prettier but I don't feel like spending more time on that so it is what it is.
